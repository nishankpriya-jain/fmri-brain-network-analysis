CH-2:
	=>spatial scales
		-microscopic,meso and macroscopic.
		-The microscopic scale refers to properties that are too small to resolve with the
		naked eye and thus require the use of microscopic techniques for visualization.
		This scale has become synonymous with networks reconstructed at the level of
		individual neurons and synapses. 	
		-the macroscopic scale refers to properties that can be resolved without the aid of microscopic methods. In 			connectomics,this scale most commonly refers to
		analyses of structural and functional interactions between large-scale populations of neurons, such as those 			characterized with MRI, MEG or EEG.
	=>Classes of Connectivity:
		-structural
		-functional
		-effective
		they also have sub-categories based on spatial scales(i.e micro,meso,macro).
		-Highprecision, invasive methods such as single unit recordings
		have high spatial and temporal resolution, but are not scalable to large-scale neural systems. Noninvasive 
		methods,such as EEG and functional MRI, are scalable but have poor spatial resolution.
		-Structural connectivity refers to the anatomical connections between neural elements.
		-Functional connectivity is estimated at the level of measured
		neurophysiological signals.
		-Effective connectivity is defined at the neuronal level and explicitly aims to uncover the direct,causal 
		influences that neural elements exert over each other’s activity. 	
	=>Directionality:
		-Structural connectivity is inherently directed, since each axon has a source and a target. However, some 
		measures of structural connectivity, such as diffusion MRI,cannot resolve this directionality and only tell 
		us whether two regions are connected or not.
		-Functional connectivity can be either directed or undirected, depending on the
		method used for measurement.
		-Effective connectivity is always directed, as it is based on a model of causal interactions between neural 
		systems.
	=>Microscale Connectomics:(neuron to neuron level)
	   	-structural connectivity
			-difficult to capture using light.
			-use of electron microscope turned the table.
			-Once reconstruction(using microscopic methods) is complete, the structures need to be annotated so 
			that the locations of individual synapses can be identified, thus forming the basis of a brain graph.
			Reconstructing connectomes in this way is computationally demanding, timeconsuming, and labor 
			intensive.Despite its poor scalability, electron microscopy remains a powerful approach for mapping 
			neuronal connectivity within spatially confined circuits. 	
			-In defining nodes, we must consider that neurons vary in their size, shape, and function, and that 
			these variations can be used to distinguish between different classes of neurons. 
	       ======Challenges:				
			-Rough estimates suggest that there may be as many as 5000 different types of neuron in the mammalian 
			brain.
			-Given this heterogeneity, should each neuron be treated the same? Should we only represent 
			connectivity between specific classes of neurons? Should we represent edges differently depending on 
			the types of neurons that they connect? 	
			-Defining edges in densely reconstructed neuronal networks also requires careful consideration.(as 
			diffrent neurons have different lengths and spreads).
 			-Beyond simply determining the presence or absence of a synaptic contact 
			between neurons, ambiguities also arise in estimating synaptic strength. 	
			-An important consideration in microscale connectomics is that the location and spatial distribution 
			of synapses can change rapidly as a function of development, experience-dependent plasticity, and 
			sleep-wake cycles. 
			-This variability suggests that the static picture obtained by a dense reconstruction may offer only a
			 partial representation of the true complexity of synaptic connectivity.  	
		-functional connectivity:
			-The classic method for measuring synchronized neuronal activity at cellular resolution uses invasive
			electrophysiology.
			- In this analysis, each node represented a specific neuron and edges were computed as correlations 
			in spiking activity.		
 			-Functional connectivity is quantified using measures of statistical dependence between neural time 
			series. 
			These time series can either be discrete (for example, spike trains) or continuous (for example, LFPs
			(low field potentials)).
			-Properties shown by Pearson correlation coefficient:
				1=> correlation coefficient only quantifies linear dependencies.
				2=> correlation coefficient is sensitive to indirect, “third-party” effects. These effects 
				arise when two network nodes show correlated activity in the absence of a direct anatomical
				connection because they are both connected to a third, intermediary node. 		 
				-Partial correlations attempt to deal with this problem(i.e. indirect effects) by estimating 
				the correlation between two nodes after removing variance that is shared with other system 
				elements.
 				3=> correlation coefficient does not distinguish between the two principal coupling 
				modeshypothesized to underlie brain function: phase coupling and amplitude coupling. 
				-In Functional MRI, the measured signals are relatively slow and functional connectivity in 
				this context is often measured as the correlation in amplitude fluctuations of the full 
				signal, rather than just the amplitude envelope.A simple solution to this
				problem is to perform a sliding window analysis.[the result is a time series of correlation 
				coefficients estimated from overlapping windows (nonoverlapping windows can also be used)].
  				4=>correlation coeeficient is undirected.
				-Alternative measure of directed functional connectivity:Granger causality.
				- For low-resolution methods such as functional MRI, variations in the speed of the 
				hemodynamic response across different areas, coupled with the complex mapping between the 
				recorded signal and underlying neuronal activity, can distort inferences about actual causal 
				interactions occurring at the neuronal level (Friston et al., 2013). Models of effective 
				connectivity can prove useful in this regard.		
			-Values of the correlation coefficient are bounded between -1 and 1, and the polarity of the
			coefficient tells us something about the type of interaction between nodes:a positive value implies 
			cooperation and integration whereas a negative value implies antagonism and segregation.	
			-popular method: calcium imaging
			 a major drawback of the technique for the study of mammalian brains is that it can only sample a 
			restricted, superficial patch of cortex at any given time.
	=>Mesoscopic scale:
		-Mesoscale connectomics typically uses microscopic methods with the aim of mapping connectivity between
 		neuronal populations or cell assemblies,rather than individual neurons.
		-Neurons aggregate into functionally related, spatially circumscribed populations,which can range in size 
		from cortical columns to larger cytoarchitectonic areas and subcortical nuclei. Each of these larger 
		areas, which may comprise thousands or millions of cells, is treated as a single node.
		-Using this coarser approach to defining nodes inevitably results in the loss of information
		encapsulated by the interactions and connectivity patterns between individual neurons.
		This loss of information is counterbalanced by an improved ability to map network structure over long 
		distances. 
		=>Structural connectivity:
			-early method used to map:invasive tract tracing.
			-Connectivity data for the Macaque (CoCoMac) database.
		  ====Challenges:
			-node definition.			
			-estimation of connection strengths.
	   	  =====
			-Advances in light microscopy and the automation of tissue processing have enabled the construction 
			of whole-brain mesoscale connectomes in mammalian brains using standardized methodologies.
			-the zones of tracer uptake in each experiment did not always conform to the anatomical boundaries of 
			the reference atlas. To get around this problem, a statistical model was used to parse the 
			fluorescence signals emanating from injections that crossed regional borders. 
			-Another method: injecting both an anterograde and retrograde tracer into different sites of the same 
			animal,genetic labeling and confocal imaging,
			-scientists parcellate the brain according to the region of interests and methodology followed.
		=>Functional connectivity:
			-method often used:use invasive electrophysiology.
			-The position of nodes isdictated by the lattice-like geometry of the electrode array, meaning that 
			the nodes do not necessarily correspond to functionally defined cell populations.
			-Functional connectivity between the nodes of an ECoG array can be estimated 
			using any one of a diverse array of different measures for quantifying the temporal dependence
			between the recorded signals.
			-The evolution of the networks over time can also be studied by using methods such as sliding
			 window analysis, in which the signal time courses are divided into either overlapping or separate
			 windows of arbitrary length, and network measures are estimated for each window.
			 -The different coupling modes and plethora of methods available for characterizing dependencies
			 between LFP signals afford a rich characterization of dynamic neural interactions,
			 in both the time and frequency domains.
			 -ECoG also offers the most direct measure of brain activity that can be acquired in living human 
			 participants, but its invasive nature means that it can only be used in neurosurgical patients. It 
			 also means that signals can only be sampled from limited, superficial areas of cortex. Deep brain 
			 structures remain inaccessible.
	=>Macroscale:
		-invasive methods are not scalable.
		-non-invasive are safe and scalable to the whole brain.
		-The coarse spatial resolution of macroscale techniques demands that we aggregate measures over ever-larger 
		populations of neurons, axons, and synapses.This reduces the precision with which we can define the nodes and 
		edges of a brain network.
					
		-DEFINING NODES:
		-A simple solution is to treat each measurement point as an individual node.(individual voxels)
 		-The advantage of this approach is that it does not entail any additional data processing or assumptions—the
		data are analyzed at the native resolution of the imaging technique and no further aggregation or averaging 
		of measurements is required.***However, there is no guarantee that the measurement points coincide with the 
		borders of functionally specialized populations of cells. 
		-Disadvantage:
		partial volume effects can smear a focal signal over several nearby voxels, meaning that the effective 
		spatial resolution may be coarser than the dimensions of an individual voxel. In this case, the connectivity 
		between neighboring voxels may be spuriously inflated simply due to the measurement process.	
		
		-Rather than relying on measurement points, we could define nodes by coregistering our data to a validated 
		parcellation scheme, such as one based on cytoarchitecture( specific areas of the cerebral cortex 
		characterized by the arrangement of their cells and each associated with particular functions).
		- In humans, Brodmann’s initial cytoarchitectonic parcellation has been mapped to a standard reference space 
		(Van Essen et al., 2013)
	
		-An alternative to cytoarchitecture is to use the macroscopic landmarks visible 
		with MRI, such as sulcal and gyral boundaries.
		-Several such parcellations exist, based on either the delineation 
		of all sulci, gyri, and major subcortical structures in a single individual (TzourioMazoyer et al., 2002), or 
		the aggregation of many such parcellations created across a population of brains to generate a probabilistic
		atlas.
		A limitation of this approach is that cytoarchitectonic areas often cut across sulcal and gyral landmarks.
		Furthermore, the regions that result from this kind of parcellation can show considerable variation in 
		size,which can bias any subsequent estimates of connectivity.(bias: large region correlated to more no of 
		other regions, averaging signals from large region result in higher SNR than the averaged time 
		series representing smaller regions).
		-One method for dealing with the problem of unequal node sizes is to parcellate the
		brain into random parcels, each of which are approximately equal in spatial extent (Figure 2.13e; Fornito et 
		al., 2010; Hagmann et al., 2007; Zalesky et al., 2010b). An advantage of this approach is that we can control 
		node size,but there is no guarantee that the boundaries of the random parcels correspond to the actual 
		borders of functional areas of the brain.
		
		-We can also use connectivity to define nodes. The logic behind this approach is that each functionally 
		specialized area of the brain possesses a unique connectional fingerprint—a distinct pattern of afferent and 
		efferent connections to other areas that, in large part, defines the function of that area.
		
		-Multivariate decomposition of functional MRI signals using techniques such as independent component analysis 
		has been used to similar ends.
		-A limitation is that some of these methods do not guarantee that putative nodes will comprise a spatially 
		contiguous collection of voxels, since spatially separate regions can show similar connectivity profiles. 
		
		-A final approach is to define nodes according to some a priori criterion.
		The advantage of these methods is that they are informed by measures of brain function and are tailored to 
		address specific hypotheses about neural systems of interest.
		
		-At macroscale:Practically, it means that the correct parcellation for one individual will not necessarily be 
		accurate for another individual.
		
		-Structural connectivity:
			-primary method: diffusion MRI.
		-Functional connectivity:
			-Functional MRI generally offers a higher spatial resolution than EEG and MEG,but its temporal 
			resolution is much lower.
			It is also unclear whether an increase in the BOLD signal reflects 
			a net increase of neuronal excitation in an area, a net increase in inhibition, or some combination 
			of both.
			-Functional connectivity in resting-state functional MRI is most commonly measured using the Pearson
			 correlation coefficient between BOLD signal time courses recorded from different regions. 	
			-it is common for these functional MRI signals to first undergo preprocessing to remove contributions 
			from nonneuronal physiological sources of noise, such as variations in heart rate and respiration, as 
			well as head motion.
			-Many other coupling metrics have been used to quantify functional connectivity in these experiments, 
			but studies of BOLD signals simulated on “ground truth” network architectures suggest that the 
			correlation coefficient and partial correlation coefficient perform reasonably well in reconstructing 
			some of the true underlying edge structure of the network.
			-Limitation for resting state fmri:
			 it is difficult to determine whether the spontaneous signal fluctuations are driven by intrinsic 
			 neuronal dynamics or transient fluctuations in mental state and cognition.
			-Advantage:
			evidence of the robustness of these networks across people and time (Damoiseaux et al., 2006; De Luca 
			et al., 2006), of their persistence across different states of consciousness and in different species 
			(Vincent et al., 2007), and of high heritability of functional connectivity and network topology 
			(Fornito et al., 2011b; Glahn et al., 2010), supports a strong contribution from intrinsic processes 
			and underlying anatomical connectivity.
			
			-Measuring functional connectivity during active task performance can offer more precise control over 
			participants’ mental states, and methods are available for isolating task-related functional 
			connectivity from other potential causes of BOLD signal covariation, such as noise, intrinsic 
			connectivity, and coactivation.
			
			== if the temporal structure of neural activity is important, then EEG or MEG is indicated; if the 
			anatomical localization of neural activity is of interest, then functional MRI may be a more 
			appropriate tool.
