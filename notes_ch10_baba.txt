NULL MODELs:
 In graph theory, a null model is a model of a network that establishes expectations under the null hypothesis.
 
 - Ideally, the null network should be matched to our observed brain network for all uninteresting properties, 
 leaving only the properties of interest to differ. Otherwise, a trivial,unmatched property can influence 
 the measure we seek to normalize, and thus confound any subsequent analyses.
 
 - Generating null networks that match all properties of an empirical network except for the one we seek to normalize 
 is difficult in practice. It is therefore typical to match only basic properties, such as network size, connection density,
 and degree distribution.These kinds of null networks can be computed using either generative models, where a network is grown by
 adding connections to a set of nodes, or randomization strategies, where the observed network is randomly rewired according to a 
 set of rules.
 
 ---GENERATIVE null models:
  Ways of considering a generative null model:
  1)(made by chance) we could create a model network with the same number of nodes and edges, but this time with edges drawn between 
  nodes completely at random (a so-called Erdős-Rényi graph). We would then measure key properties of this network, such as its 
  degree distribution, clustering coefficient, path length, and so on, and compare these values to those computed in the empirical 
  brain network. If the two sets of measures match, our analysis suggests that the brain is wired completely at random.
  2)They define expectations for network organization under a specific hypothesis. The hypothesis is determined by the rules(like 
  random connectivity) of the generative model.
 
  Viewing generative models from this perspective allows us to define two major applications in the analysis of brain networks:
  1)to uncover critical constraints on brain network wiring.
    - In this application, we aim to specify a model that will accurately reproduce the topological properties observed in the brain.
  2)to set expectations under the null hypothesis
    - Rather than attempting to model all relevant features of brain network organization, we may simply ask whether a particular 
    property is expressed in the brain to a greater extent than expected by chance.
 
 GENERATIVE MODELS FOR BRAIN NETWORKS:
  ------- 
 Erdős-Rényi Networks:
   -In this model, each node has a uniform probability of being connected.
   - In Gilbert’s variation, Erdős-Rényi networks are characterized by two parameters, the number of nodes in the network, N, and 
   the probability, p, that a connection is found between an arbitrary pair of nodes. 
   -The advantage of the Erdős-Rényi null model is that it is simple to generate, and analytic expressions exist for computing many 
   commonly used topological metrics, such as clustering and path length.   
   - the Erdős-Rényi network does not provide a very good model of many real-world systems, lacking basic properties such as a small-
   world organization and a heterogeneous degree distribution that allows for the presence of highly connected hubs. 
 
 Watts-Strogatz Networks:
     <k>=a desired mean node degree.
   - The nodes are equidistantly positioned in two-dimensional space along a ring, such that each node has exactly two immediate 
   neighbors. We then add N<k>/2 connections to construct a lattice network. In particular, for each node, connections are drawn 
   between it and its hki closest neighbors, <k>/2 on each side. 
   The final step is to randomly rewire each connection with probability pWS. Rewiring is performed in such a way that avoids self-
   loops and connection duplication.

 Barabási-Albert Networks:
   -create models of networks with more realistic, scale-free degree distributions.
   -Node degrees grow with iterations in a “rich get richer” manner
   -Crucially, these v connections are not randomly assigned to existing nodes. Instead,
   the probability that a connection is assigned to an existing node is proportional to its current nodal degree.
 
  Erdős-Rényi networks, the simplest of the three, allow us to formalize the concept of random networks. They can be generated to a
  prescribed size, connection density, and mean node degree. Watts-Strogatz networks can also be generated to satisfy these 
  specifications, but additionally display small-world organization. Finally, Barabási-Albert networks display a scale-free degree 
  distribution, but are not necessarily small-world networks. 
   
 -NULL NETWORKS FROM REWIRING CONNECTIONS:
  	-- null networks generated through an iterative process in which an observed network is rewired to generate a random 
	   topology,albeit with specific constraints. 
	--these networks are not completely random, like the Erdos-Renyi model, but they are randomized with respect to an initial, 
	empirically determined starting point.
    -Maslov-Sneppen Rewiring:
       - The rewired network will have the same number of nodes, same number of edges,and same degree sequence as the original 
       network, with all other properties being randomized.
       -The Maslov-Sneppen algorithm uses an iterative rewiring procedure. At each iteration, we randomly select two connections, 
       (u1, u2) and (u3, u4). We then move (rewire) these links to introduce two new connections (u1, u 4) and (u2, u3). If one or 
       both of these new connections already exist, we abandon the iteration and randomly select another pair of connections.
 
 -Rewiring Connections in Weighted and Signed Networks:
     Rubinov and Sporns algorithm (generalization of Maslov-Sneppen Rewiring):
     Steps:
     1)The first step involves an iterative connection-switching rule. At each iteration, we randomly select four nodes such that 
     we have positive connections (u1, u2) and (u 3, u4), and negative connections (u1, u3) and (u2, u4). We then reverse the signs 
     of these four connections.
     2)The second step involves randomizing the connection weights so that the positive and negative strengths of each node are 
     approximately preserved.
      
 -Lattice Null Networks:
    When embedded in Euclidean space, lattice networks appear as tiling patterns or grids, since most of their connections are 
    between spatially proximal nodes
    NOTE:NEED of lattice null networks:
     Lattice networks are highly clustered with long path lengths,whereas random networks have low clustering and short path 
     lengths.
    - By selectively implementing only those rewiring steps that result in a connectivity matrix with more connections clustered 
    around the matrix diagonal, we can generate random networks with lattice structure.
 -Spatial Embedding:
    The spatial locations of the nodes of a connectome are  physically constrained by the geometry of the space in which they are
    embedded.
